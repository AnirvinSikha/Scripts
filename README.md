Bash custom scripts that I use 

How to add/change bash script:

When creating an alias you want to change your scripts in the bash_profile folder
1. In terminal type 
``` open ~/.bash_profile```
2. Use the alias keyword to create a new command, be sure to use single quotes and start the command directly after the = sign.
```alias gstat='git status ```
3. Outside, in terminal, make sure the command is synced by calling
```source ~/.bash_profile```
